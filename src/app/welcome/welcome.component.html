  What is Lorem Ipsum? Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and
  typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text
  ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
  scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
  centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
  essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
  Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with
  desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
  Ipsum. Why do we use it? It is a long established fact that a reader will be
  distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The
  point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution
  of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look
  like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors
  now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem
  ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions
  have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose
  (injected humour and the like). Where does it come from? Contrary to popular
  belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
  classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard
  McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up
  one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage,
  and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered
  the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of
  "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
  written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very
  popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum
  dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of
  Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested.
  Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero
  are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English
  versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham. Where can I get some? There
  are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority
  have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words
  which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage
  of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden
  in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to
  repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on
  the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a
  handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks
  reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from
  repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
